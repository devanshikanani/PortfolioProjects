Summary

This case study was completed by Devanshi Kanani in October 2022 as part of the Google Data Analytics Course Capstone. This study was done using R and tableau.

About the company: 

Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. Its program features 5,824 bicycles and 692 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

The have 3 different pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The task: 

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and why casual riders would buy a membership. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members
